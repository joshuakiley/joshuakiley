## Road to Code
Way way back in 2007 I upgraded my Windows XP laptop to Windows Vista and everything broke.

I didn't know anything about fixing software at the time; the engineering high school I graduated from had focused more on the hardware side of digital electronics. After being told by Microsoft and HP that I would have to purchase a new license key to reinstall Windows XP, I decided to start reading up on Linux.

I finally got the courage to install Linux on my computer to revive it and everything broke.

Unlike Windows, I didn't feel compelled to turn to the company support line, because it didn't exist. Instead, I was able to find a very friendly community who helped me get through my first, and terrifying, and exciting experience with BASH.

After years of BASH, a little bit og hacking on Android, and Linux, and after [this PCWorld article](https://www.pcworld.com/article/468577/google_workaround_found_by_chinese_critical_of_internet_censorship.html), I left my teaching job in China and got a job at one of my favorite Linux companies, System76.

Now I provide IT services to companies in the New York City area in hopes that one day I might get hired by Google, Rockstar, Red Hat, or land a job at a school.
